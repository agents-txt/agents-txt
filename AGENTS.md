# AGENTS.md: agentstxt repository

**For AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) working on this codebase.**

This file is your orientation map. Read it before making changes.

---

## What this repository is

The **`agents.txt` standard** plus its **reference implementation**. Two distinct concerns sharing one workspace:

1. **The specification** at [`spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`](spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md). Formal, versioned, CC0. Defines a discovery file format that announces what an AI agent can do on a website (Payments, Authorization, MCP, Skills).
2. **A live deployment** at [agentstxt.dev](https://agentstxt.dev) that serves the spec, hosts demos, runs an MCP server, and an agent-auth worker. Three separate Cloudflare Workers, one Astro site.

Note: this repository does **not** contain the `herald` npm toolkit. That is a sibling project (a generator + middleware that supports the spec) and lives in its own folder one level up. When working in this repo, you should not need it. If a user asks about generating files via the CLI, point them at herald but do not import or assume it.

All three workers (`site`, `mcp`, `auth`) deploy to Cloudflare and have no shared dependency graph. They are intentionally independent.

## What lives where

### Specification: `spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`

The single source of truth for the standard. Versioned (`v1.0` at time of writing). Defines:

- Wire format (UTF-8 plain text, RFC 3629)
- Required and optional directives
- Companion `agents.json` schema (UTF-8 JSON, RFC 8259)
- Capability blocks: Payments (§5), Authorization (§6), MCP (§7), Skills (§8), A2A (§9)
- `x-` prefix convention for experimental protocol identifiers (§3.1)
- Conformance requirements

Treat this file as **load-bearing**. Changes here can break every parser, generator, and validator in the ecosystem.

### Reference site: `site/`

Astro 6, Cloudflare Workers (`@astrojs/cloudflare`), Tailwind v4. The site does three things:

1. **Hosts the spec text** at human-readable URLs (`/spec`, `/demo`, `/blog`).
2. **Demonstrates the spec live** by serving its own `/agents.txt`, `/agents.json`, etc. from `public/`.
3. **Acts as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** via `src/worker.ts`: proxies `/mcp` to the MCP worker, `/.well-known/agent-configuration` and `/agent/*` to the auth worker, and self-serves two synthetic gated routes — `/x402` (x402 v2 on Solana) and `/mpp` (MPP via `mppx`).

The `/x402` and `/mpp` handlers in `worker.ts` are **deliberate self-contained references**. `/x402` hand-rolls a single x402 v2 402 response on Solana mainnet with `payTo` from `SOLANA_ADDRESS`, against the public facilitator at `https://x402.org/facilitator/settle`. `/mpp` runs `Mppx.compose(tempo, stripe)` per-request and emits a `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` challenge with the recipient base64-encoded inside the `request` parameter, gated on `TREASURY_TEMPO` (Tempo) and/or `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`+`STRIPE_NETWORK_ID` (Stripe) and signed with `MPP_SECRET_KEY`. The two routes are kept independent on purpose so the demos read one protocol each; a production site with a real gated resource can emit both `accepts[]` and `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` from a single 402 if it wants. Do not factor either handler out into a shared library inside this repo.

### MCP server: `mcp/`

A Cloudflare Worker exposing the `agents.txt` spec to AI agents over Model Context Protocol. Tools: `get_spec`, `parse_agents_txt`, `validate_agents_txt`, `validate_agents_json`, `audit_site`, `get_skill`. Built on `hono`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `agents`. Deploys to `mcp.agentstxt.dev`.

`audit_site` does the heavy lifting: it fetches `/agents.txt`, `/agents.json`, and `/robots.txt`, validates the §4.5 serving headers (Content-Type, CORS, Cache-Control), runs the §3-§10 directive validators on `agents.txt`, schema-validates `agents.json` per §12, scans both files for accidental treasury / secret leaks per §12.4 / §14, and cross-checks that the two files declare consistent capabilities (payments / authorization / MCP / Skills / A2A). Out of scope: full RFC 9309 audit, sitemap.xml, llms.txt. Those are governed by other specs.

The MCP package centralises every recognised protocol identifier in [`mcp/src/protocols.ts`](mcp/src/protocols.ts): `PAYMENT_PROTOCOLS`, `AUTH_PROTOCOLS`, `MPP_METHODS`, `BLOCK_OPENERS`, plus `isAcceptedPaymentIdentifier` / `isAcceptedAuthIdentifier` helpers that accept both registered identifiers and `x-` prefixed experimental ones. Adding a registered identifier or a new block-opening directive is a single edit there; the parser, validators, and audit tool all read from it.

### Agent-auth worker: `auth/`

A Cloudflare Worker implementing the agent-auth protocol referenced by the spec. Endpoints: `/.well-known/agent-configuration`, `/agent/register`, `/capability/execute`. Uses Ed25519 JWTs and Workers KV for agent state. Has 55 Vitest tests; keep them green.

---

## Working in this repo

### Setup

```bash
nvm use 24
pnpm install
pnpm build           # builds site + mcp + auth
pnpm test            # auth has tests; the others print "no tests"
```

### Per sub-package

```bash
pnpm site:dev
pnpm mcp:dev
pnpm auth:dev

pnpm site:deploy       # Astro build + wrangler deploy
pnpm mcp:deploy[:prod]
pnpm auth:deploy[:prod]
```

### Tech stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (NodeNext, strict mode)
- **Site:** Astro 6, Tailwind 4, Cloudflare Workers
- **Workers:** `wrangler` for dev/deploy, `tsc --noEmit` for typecheck
- **Tests:** Vitest (only the `auth` worker uses it currently)
- **Node:** ≥ 20.12

### What does **not** live here

- No npm-publishable packages. Nothing in `agentstxt/` is published.
- No Turbo. Three independent workers; nothing to orchestrate beyond `pnpm -r`.
- No shared TypeScript packages. Each sub-package owns its own deps.
- No herald code. Treat herald as an external sibling, even though it lives one folder up.

---

## Editing rules

These constraints exist to keep the spec credible, the reference deployment working, and the boundary with sibling repos clean.

### `spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`

- **Treat as the canonical artifact for the entire ecosystem.** Editorial polish (typos, clarifying examples) is fine via PR. Structural changes (new directives, schema fields, conformance shifts) require RFC discussion in the PR description.
- Bump the version line (`Version: 1.0-draft`) when changing semantics.
- Mirror any schema change into `agents.json` examples and any validator code in `mcp/src/` that asserts the schema.

### `site/`

- The site is the canonical *demonstration* of the spec. Its `public/agents.txt` and `public/agents.json` should always be valid against the latest published spec. If you change the spec, regenerate or hand-edit those files in the same PR.
- `worker.ts` is the reference x402 v2 implementation at `/x402` and the reference MPP implementation at `/mpp`. Keep both self-contained. Do not import from `@herald/*`. Do not move payment logic into a shared internal module.
- Astro pages serve user-facing content; do not put runtime logic in them. Push it into `worker.ts` or sibling workers.

### `mcp/`

- New MCP tools should be additive. Do not break existing tool signatures (`get_spec`, `parse_agents_txt`, etc.); third-party MCP clients may depend on them.
- When the spec changes, update `validate_agents_txt` / `validate_agents_json` to match. Tests in `auth/` cover auth invariants but the validator quality is on you to assess by exercising it against `site/public/agents.txt` and `agents.json`.
- The protocol registry at [`src/protocols.ts`](mcp/src/protocols.ts) is the single source of truth for recognised identifiers. Adding a new registered payment or auth identifier is one edit there; the parser, validators, and audit tool follow automatically.

### `auth/`

- Cryptographic primitives (Ed25519 verification, JWT parsing) must not be hand-rolled outside the existing helpers. If a primitive is missing, prefer `@noble/*` libraries.
- Never log JWT bodies, KV values, or anything that could contain agent secrets.
- The 55 Vitest tests are the contract for the worker's behaviour. Always run `pnpm auth:test` before pushing changes there.

### General

- **Never commit** `.env`, `.dev.vars`, `wrangler-account.json`, secret keys, or wallet private keys.
- **Run `pnpm build`** before opening a PR; it catches type errors across all three workers.
- **Keep the three workers independent.** If two of them need the same code, write it twice; the duplication is intentional and small.
- **Follow existing code style.** No Prettier/Biome config inside `agentstxt/` yet; match the formatting you see.

## Skills available in this repo

Skills are agent-installable capability packages stored under `skills/`.

### `adopt-agents-txt`

Walks a developer through adopting the `agents.txt` standard on their own site. Covers reading the spec, choosing an adoption path (hand-write / generator / library), validating the output, and serving it correctly.

Use this skill when a user is working in *their own* repository and asks how to make their site agent-readable. It is **not** for working in this repo (the agentstxt monorepo itself).

---

## Outside the repo boundary

- **`herald`** — an npm-published toolkit (CLI + framework adapters + payment middleware) that generates and serves the discovery files defined by this spec. It lives in a sibling folder, has its own README/AGENTS/CLAUDE, and is intentionally decoupled. Do not import its code into anything in this repo. Mention it to users only when they ask about automation.
- **`mppx`**: third-party SDK for Machine Payments Protocol. Used by `site/src/worker.ts` directly via `mppx/server` for the `/mpp` route. Treat as an external dependency. Drop both `mppx` and `stripe` from `site/package.json` if MPP support is ever removed again.
- **`@x402/*`**: Coinbase x402 v2 SDKs. **Not used by this repo.** `site/worker.ts` hand-rolls x402 v2 against the public facilitator at `https://x402.org/facilitator/settle` instead, so the reference implementation fits in one file.

## Adding a new protocol to the standard

Three paths, in increasing levels of formalization. The spec stays small by absorbing only protocols that have a stable specification of their own.

### 1. Experimental identifier (`x-` prefix)

No spec change required. A site advertises an unregistered protocol with the `x-` prefix (§3.1): `Protocols: x402, x-mypay` in `agents.txt`, `payments["x-mypay"]: {}` in `agents.json`. Parsers must accept; validators must not warn. This is the runway for a protocol to ship in production before formal registration.

The reference deployment's parser, validators, and `audit_site` tool all already accept `x-` prefixed identifiers without warnings (see `isAcceptedPaymentIdentifier` / `isAcceptedAuthIdentifier` in [`mcp/src/protocols.ts`](mcp/src/protocols.ts)). No code changes needed when a new experimental protocol enters the wild.

### 2. Register an identifier in an existing block (§5 Payments or §6 Authorization)

The protocol fits the existing semantics of an existing block and is stable enough to register. Steps:

1. Open a PR against [`spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`](spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md). Add a subsection to §5 or §6 describing what the identifier signals to an agent and where the protocol's own details live (well-known path, response challenge, SDK).
2. Bump the `Version:` line.
3. Append the identifier to `PAYMENT_PROTOCOLS` or `AUTH_PROTOCOLS` in [`mcp/src/protocols.ts`](mcp/src/protocols.ts). The MCP validators and audit tool pick it up via `isAcceptedPaymentIdentifier` / `isAcceptedAuthIdentifier`. No other validator code edits required.
4. If the protocol carries structured fields in `agents.json` (chains, methods, etc.), document the per-protocol object shape in §12.2 and §12.3, then add a per-protocol JSON shape check in [`mcp/src/tools/validate_agents.ts`](mcp/src/tools/validate_agents.ts) and [`audit_site.ts`](mcp/src/tools/audit_site.ts) alongside the existing x402 / MPP checks.

### 3. Add a new capability block (the A2A path)

The protocol does not fit any existing block. This is what happened with A2A in v1.0: A2A defines its own well-known path but multi-agent sites and non-canonical AgentCard paths needed a discovery directive, so the spec gained a new §9 with an `A2A:` directive.

Steps (use the A2A diff as the reference):

1. **Spec section** in `AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`. Define the directive name, wire format (single value per line, repeatable, HTTPS-only), the discovery gap the block fills, and the relationship to existing blocks (independent or constrained).
2. **Directive table entry** in §3.1.
3. **`agents.json` schema** entry in §12.2, with a field-notes paragraph in §12.3. For URL-carrying blocks, mirror the `mcp[]` / `skills[]` shape: array of `{ url, description? }`, description is `agents.json`-only because the announcement layer (`agents.txt`) stays terse.
4. **Reference deployment**:
   - Register the directive in `BLOCK_OPENERS` inside [`mcp/src/protocols.ts`](mcp/src/protocols.ts). This is how the parser distinguishes "I expected this to open a block" from "this is an unknown directive that should fall through to `extensions`".
   - Add a parsing case in [`mcp/src/tools/parse_agents_txt.ts`](mcp/src/tools/parse_agents_txt.ts) to collect the values into the structured output.
   - Add validation rules in [`mcp/src/tools/validate_agents.ts`](mcp/src/tools/validate_agents.ts) (txt-side URL shape and HTTPS, json-side array shape).
   - Add the §N directive check and §12.2 array check in [`mcp/src/tools/audit_site.ts`](mcp/src/tools/audit_site.ts), plus the cross-file consistency check that the URL set in `agents.txt` equals the URL set in `agents.json`.
5. **Renumbering**. If the new block is inserted before any existing section (the A2A change inserted between §8 Skills and the previous §9 Relationship), renumber the subsequent sections and update every `§N` reference in `audit_site.ts`'s rule messages. Search the audit code for `§` to find them all.
6. **Reference site** (`site/`): if the site adopts the new block, regenerate or hand-edit `site/public/agents.txt` and `site/public/agents.json` in the same PR.

Pure additive change at the spec layer: parsers ignore unknown directives, so old files stay valid, and old agents continue to work against new files (they just don't see the new block).

Two reviewer approvals required for spec changes per the project's RFC discipline.
