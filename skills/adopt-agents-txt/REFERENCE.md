# `adopt-agents-txt` — Reference

Full directive list, `agents.json` schema, capability block examples, and hand-write templates per framework. Open this from SKILL.md when the user asks about a specific directive's syntax, an `agents.json` field, or the canonical layout for a capability block.

Canonical spec: [`spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`](https://agentstxt.dev/spec). When in doubt, the spec wins.

---

## `agents.txt` directives

Plain UTF-8 text. One directive per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments. Blank lines are ignored. The file MUST end with a newline.

| Directive | Cardinality | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Site-Name:` | 1 (required) | `Site-Name: My Site` | Human-readable site name |
| `Site-URL:` | 1 (required) | `Site-URL: https://mysite.com` | Canonical URL |
| `Site-Description:` | 0–1 | `Site-Description: A blog about distributed systems.` | One-sentence purpose |
| `Payments:` | 0–1 | `Payments: x402, mpp` | Comma-separated list of supported payment protocols |
| `Authorization:` | 0–1 | `Authorization: agent-auth` | Authentication protocol identifier |
| `Identity:` | 0–1 | `Identity: required` | When agents must authenticate before any interaction |
| `MCP:` | 0–N | `MCP: https://mysite.com/mcp` | URL of an MCP server (Streamable HTTP transport) |
| `Skills:` | 0–N | `Skills: https://mysite.com/.well-known/skills.json` | URL of a skill manifest |

**Order:** Site-* directives first, capability blocks after. Within a block, primary directive first (e.g., `Payments:`) followed by any sub-directives if the spec defines them.

**Casing:** Directive names are case-insensitive on parse but SHOULD be written as `Title-Case:` for human readability.

## Minimal valid file

```
# /agents.txt
# Spec: https://agentstxt.dev

Site-Name: My Site
Site-URL: https://mysite.com
```

This is conformant. The site exists, has a name, declares no capabilities. Most non-monetized read-only sites stop here.

---

## Capability blocks

### Payments

```
Site-Name: My Site
Site-URL: https://mysite.com

Payments: x402, mpp
```

The directive declares which payment protocols the site accepts. Order of values is hint-only. `agents.json` carries the structured details (chains, default pricing). Implementation is on the site's `402` response bodies — `agents.txt` never carries wallet addresses or amounts.

Supported values:

- `x402` — HTTP-native crypto micropayments (per-request, EIP-3009 / SVM). Spec: [x402.org](https://x402.org).
- `mpp` — Machine Payments Protocol (session-based, fiat + USDC via Stripe SPT or Tempo). IETF draft: `draft-ryan-httpauth-payment`.

Future values can be added without spec bump as long as they're identifier strings.

### Authorization

```
Authorization: agent-auth
Identity: required
```

`Authorization:` declares the agent-identification protocol. Currently spec-recognized: `agent-auth`. Discovery endpoint is hardcoded at `/.well-known/agent-configuration` per the agent-auth protocol.

`Identity: required` is a site-level policy — if present, agents MUST authenticate before any interaction (not just before capability execution). Useful for sites that gate all reads on agent identity.

### MCP

```
MCP: https://mysite.com/mcp
MCP: https://mysite.com/admin/mcp
```

URL(s) of MCP server(s). Transport is always Streamable HTTP per current MCP spec. Agents call these URLs with the `MCP-Session-Id` handshake. Sites that publish multiple MCP endpoints (e.g., one for public tools, one for admin) emit multiple `MCP:` lines.

### Skills

```
Skills: https://mysite.com/.well-known/skills.json
```

URL of a skill manifest — a JSON file enumerating installable agent skills. `agents.json` references the same URL under `skills.url`. Skill manifest format is defined by the `agentskills.io` companion spec.

---

## `agents.json` schema

Same information as `agents.txt`, in machine-friendly JSON. Sites SHOULD serve both — `agents.txt` for plain-text discovery, `agents.json` for structured pre-screening.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "site": {
    "name": "My Site",
    "url": "https://mysite.com",
    "description": "A blog about distributed systems."
  },
  "payments": {
    "protocols": ["x402", "mpp"],
    "pricing": { "amount": "0.001", "token": "USDC" },
    "x402": {
      "chains": ["eip155:8453", "solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp"],
      "description": "Per-request micropayments via the Coinbase x402 facilitator."
    },
    "mpp": {
      "description": "Session-based payments via Stripe (fiat + Solana USDC) and Tempo (USDC.e)."
    }
  },
  "authorization": {
    "protocols": ["agent-auth"],
    "discovery": "/.well-known/agent-configuration",
    "identityRequired": false
  },
  "mcp": [
    { "url": "https://mysite.com/mcp", "type": "streamable-http", "description": "Public tools." }
  ],
  "skills": {
    "url": "https://mysite.com/.well-known/skills.json"
  }
}
```

### Field rules

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | Always `"1.0"` for v1.0-draft compliance |
| `site.name`, `site.url` | yes | Mirror the `Site-Name` / `Site-URL` directives |
| `site.description` | no | Plain text, ≤ 200 chars |
| `payments.protocols` | when payments declared | Array; subset of `["x402", "mpp"]` |
| `payments.pricing` | recommended | `{ amount: string (decimal), token: string }`. Major-unit decimal. Wallet addresses NEVER appear here. |
| `payments.x402.chains` | when x402 declared | CAIP-2 network IDs. Lets agents pre-check chain support. |
| `payments.<protocol>.description` | optional | One-sentence human-readable description |
| `authorization.protocols` | when auth declared | Default `["agent-auth"]` |
| `authorization.discovery` | when auth declared | Always `/.well-known/agent-configuration` for `agent-auth` |
| `authorization.identityRequired` | optional | Mirrors `Identity:` directive |
| `mcp[]` | when MCP declared | Array of `{ url, type, description? }`. `type` is always `"streamable-http"` for HTTP MCP. |
| `skills.url` | when skills declared | URL of a skill manifest |

### Security invariants for `agents.json`

These fields MUST NEVER appear:

- Wallet addresses (`evmAddress`, `solanaAddress`, `tempoRecipient`, etc.)
- Stripe secret keys, MPP HMAC keys
- API keys, JWKs, session tokens
- Internal URLs that aren't meant to be discovered

They live in `402` response bodies, server env, or protected admin surfaces.

## Hand-write templates

### Static site (Astro / Next.js / Vite / Hugo / Jekyll)

Save the file under whatever directory the framework serves as `/`:

```
public/
├── agents.txt          ← copy from minimal valid file above
├── agents.json         ← copy from schema example above
├── robots.txt          (optional, if not generated)
├── llms.txt            (optional)
└── sitemap.xml         (optional)
```

Build artefacts are passthrough — Astro/Next/Vite copy `public/` verbatim, Hugo/Jekyll copy `static/`. No code changes required.

### Express

```ts
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const SITE = { name: 'My Site', url: 'https://mysite.com', description: '…' }

app.get('/agents.txt', (_, res) => {
  res.type('text/plain').send(
    `# /agents.txt\n` +
    `# Spec: https://agentstxt.dev\n\n` +
    `Site-Name: ${SITE.name}\n` +
    `Site-URL: ${SITE.url}\n`
  )
})

app.get('/agents.json', (_, res) => {
  res.json({
    version: '1.0',
    site: SITE,
  })
})

app.listen(3000)
```

### Hono

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()
const SITE = { name: 'My Site', url: 'https://mysite.com' }

app.get('/agents.txt', (c) =>
  c.text(`Site-Name: ${SITE.name}\nSite-URL: ${SITE.url}\n`),
)

app.get('/agents.json', (c) =>
  c.json({ version: '1.0', site: SITE }),
)

export default app
```

### Next.js App Router

`app/agents.txt/route.ts`:

```ts
const SITE = { name: 'My Site', url: 'https://mysite.com' }

export function GET() {
  return new Response(
    `Site-Name: ${SITE.name}\nSite-URL: ${SITE.url}\n`,
    { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' } },
  )
}
```

`app/agents.json/route.ts`:

```ts
const SITE = { name: 'My Site', url: 'https://mysite.com' }

export function GET() {
  return Response.json({ version: '1.0', site: SITE })
}
```

### Cloudflare Worker

```ts
const SITE = { name: 'My Site', url: 'https://mysite.com' }

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const url = new URL(request.url)
    if (url.pathname === '/agents.txt') {
      return new Response(
        `Site-Name: ${SITE.name}\nSite-URL: ${SITE.url}\n`,
        { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' } },
      )
    }
    if (url.pathname === '/agents.json') {
      return Response.json({ version: '1.0', site: SITE })
    }
    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })
  },
}
```

## Validating the result

### Via the public MCP server

The reference MCP server at `mcp.agentstxt.dev` exposes:

| Tool | Input | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `validate_agents_txt` | `{ content: string }` | Compliance report against the v1.0-draft spec |
| `validate_agents_json` | `{ content: string }` | JSON schema check |
| `check_site` | `{ url: string }` | Fetches the live URL and runs both validators |
| `parse_agents_txt` | `{ content: string }` | Returns the parsed directive map |
| `get_spec` | `{ section?: string }` | Returns the spec text or a specific section |

Any MCP-aware client (Claude Desktop, mcp-inspector, etc.) can call these.

### Manual

```bash
# agents.txt — should be 200 OK, text/plain, UTF-8
curl -i https://example.com/agents.txt

# agents.json — must parse, must include version and site
curl https://example.com/agents.json | jq '.version, .site.name, .site.url'
```

If both files are present, confirm they declare the same capabilities. Mismatches confuse agents.

## Common questions to answer in-line

- **"Do I need both `agents.txt` and `agents.json`?"** — Strictly, just `agents.txt`. The companion is recommended for any site with capability blocks because it lets agents pre-screen without parsing plain text. For a minimal site declaring only `Site-Name`/`Site-URL`, `agents.txt` alone is fine.
- **"Can I add custom directives?"** — The spec is extensible (new capability blocks can be added without breaking parsers). Custom directives outside the spec must use `X-` prefix to signal non-standard. Better: open an RFC against the spec.
- **"Where do wallet addresses go?"** — Never in discovery files. They appear in `402` response bodies via the protocol's own conventions (e.g. `accepts[].payTo` for x402 v2). Discovery files only signal *which protocols* are supported, not the wire details.
- **"What if my site doesn't accept payments?"** — Drop `Payments:` and the `payments` block from `agents.json`. A site declaring no monetization is fully conformant.
- **"How do I update the file when I change a capability?"** — Re-deploy. Cache headers should be ≤ 1 hour for `agents.*` files since they're discovery surfaces — agents will pick up changes within that window.

## When this skill ends

Hand off to:

- **Spec maintainers** for structural questions about the standard itself.
- **Per-framework documentation** (Astro / Next.js / Hono / Express / Cloudflare Workers / Hugo / Jekyll) for their static-asset serving conventions.
- **agentify's own setup skill** when the user picks the generator path and wants the CLI walkthrough.
- **MCP / agent-auth / x402 / mppx documentation** for protocol-implementation depth — this skill stops at "declare the capability"; wiring the actual `402` handler or MCP server is the next conversation.
