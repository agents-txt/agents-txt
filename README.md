`agents.txt` is the discovery file an AI agent reads to find out what your site supports — payments, authorization, MCP servers, agent skills — without needing to know the implementation details of any particular protocol.

It fills **Layer 4** of the agent-readiness stack:

```
Layer 1 — ACCESS CONTROL      /robots.txt   (RFC 9309)         "You may enter my house"
Layer 2 — PAGE INVENTORY      /sitemap.xml  (sitemaps.org 0.9) "Here's how to navigate it"
Layer 3 — CONTENT BRIEFING    /llms.txt     (llmstxt.org)      "Here's what's inside"
Layer 4 — AGENT CAPABILITIES  /agents.txt   (this spec)        "Here's what you can do here"
```

Where the existing layers handle access policies, indexes, and content guidance, `agents.txt` declares **what an agent can do**: pay, authenticate, connect to an MCP server, fetch installable skills. The implementation always lives in the protocol's own layer (`402` response bodies, `/.well-known/agent-configuration`, MCP transport, etc.) — `agents.txt` is the announcement, never the duplicate.

This repository contains:

- **The spec** — [`spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`](spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md) (CC0)
- **A live reference deployment** at [agentstxt.dev](https://agentstxt.dev) — Astro site + Cloudflare Worker
- **An MCP server** at [mcp.agentstxt.dev](https://mcp.agentstxt.dev) — exposes the spec to agents via Model Context Protocol
- **An agent-auth Cloudflare Worker** — Ed25519 JWT verification, `/.well-known/agent-configuration`, capability execution

## What `agents.txt` looks like

```
# agents.txt
# Spec: https://agentstxt.dev

Site-Name: My Site
Site-URL: https://mysite.com

Payments: x402, mpp
Authorization: agent-auth
MCP: https://mysite.com/mcp
Skills: https://mysite.com/.well-known/skills.json
```

That's it. Six directives, plain UTF-8, served at `/agents.txt`. Each directive declares that the site *supports* a protocol; the protocol-specific details (pricing, scopes, transport, skill manifests) live in the protocol's own discovery surface.

The structured companion **`agents.json`** carries the same information in machine-friendly JSON with richer per-block detail (chain identifiers, default pricing, capability descriptions). Sites SHOULD serve both — same relationship as `llms.txt` ↔ `llms-full.txt`.

---

## Adopting the standard

You have three paths, in increasing automation:

### 1. Hand-write it

The format is plain text. Read [the spec](spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md), copy the directives that apply to your site, save the file as `/agents.txt`. Repeat for `agents.json` if you want the structured companion. Total time: 5 minutes.

### 2. Generate it

The community reference generator [**agentify**](https://github.com/agentstxt/agents.txt) (a sibling project, distributed via npm) emits `agents.txt`, `agents.json`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` from a single config file. Useful if you also want the lower layers of the stack regenerated alongside, or if you're hosting on Express / Hono / Next.js and want a payment middleware wired up automatically.

```bash
npx agentify init
npx agentify generate --out ./public
```

agentify is **a nice-to-have, not a requirement**. The spec is implementation-agnostic — anyone can write a generator in any language. agentify exists because we needed a first-party adoption path; it shouldn't dictate yours.

### 3. Look at the reference site

The live deployment at [agentstxt.dev](https://agentstxt.dev) is a working agentic site. Source: [`site/`](site/). It hand-rolls its `/donate` x402 + MPP endpoint inside [`site/src/worker.ts`](site/src/worker.ts) so you can read a real, dependency-free implementation of payment serving against the spec. Use it as a reference when building your own server.

## Development

```bash
# Setup
cd agentstxt
nvm use 24
pnpm install

# Build everything (site + workers)
pnpm build

# Run tests (auth has 55, the others have none)
pnpm test

# Per sub-package
pnpm site:dev          # Astro dev server for agentstxt.dev
pnpm mcp:dev           # Wrangler dev for the MCP worker
pnpm auth:dev          # Wrangler dev for the agent-auth worker

pnpm site:deploy       # Astro build + wrangler deploy
pnpm mcp:deploy        # Wrangler deploy (minified)
pnpm mcp:deploy:prod
pnpm auth:deploy
pnpm auth:deploy:prod
```

Each sub-package owns its own toolchain — Astro for the site, Wrangler + `tsc --noEmit` for the workers. There is no Turbo at this level because the three workers have no shared dependency graph; they're three independent edge deployments to the same domain group.

## Status

**Spec:** v1.0-draft. Format and schema are stable. Major capability blocks (Payments, Authorization, MCP, Skills) are settled. Patches accepted via PR; structural changes will be RFCs against [`spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md`](spec/AGENTS-TXT-STANDARD.md).

**Reference deployment:** Live at [agentstxt.dev](https://agentstxt.dev). The MCP server is live at [mcp.agentstxt.dev](https://mcp.agentstxt.dev). The agent-auth worker runs as a separate service.

**Adoption:** Open. The spec is CC0; anyone can implement it without restriction. The reference workers in this repo are Apache 2.0 — vendor in or fork freely.
